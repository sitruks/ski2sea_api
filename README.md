# Tableau Web Data Connector with a JSON API using Ski to Sea Race Data  

## Instructions (Dev Server)

- navigate from the `root` to `ski2sea_api/wdc`
- run `npm install`
- run `npm start`
- navigate to http://localhost:3333/

## Node Express App WDC Example

- This WDC connects to the Ski to Sea API, referenced below.
- After trying out just about every Tableau example (./webdataconnector/Examples), I ended up modeling the app after the OAuthProxyExample Express App example for this first attempt.
- @github **soitknows**'s repo was also a good inspiration
