# Tableau Web Data Connector with a JSON API using Ski to Sea Race Data  

## Node Express App WDC Example

    This is my first run at building a Tableau WDC. After trying out just about every Tableau example (./webdataconnector/Examples), I ended up modeling the app after the OAuthProxyExample Express App example.  
    
    This WDC connects to the Ski to Sea API, referenced below.
