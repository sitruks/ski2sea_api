There are a few steps you need to follow to run the sample locally:

 1.  In this folder (wdc), run 'npm install'.
 2. 
 3. 
 4. 
 5. 
 6. Dance a little, you're probably done.  

You will now have the sample WDC hosted at localhost:3333/index.html.  Enter that URL
into the WDC simulator or into Tableau to use the connector.
