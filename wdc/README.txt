There are a few steps you need to follow to run the sample locally:

    1.  In this folder (wdc), run 'npm install'  
    2.  Follow whatever prompts node provides that you feel necessary, i.e. 'npm audit fix', otherwise just skip to #3  
    3.  type 'npm start', still from the wdc folder  
    4.  You will now have the sample WDC hosted at localhost:3333/index.html.  Enter that URL
into the WDC simulator (from webdataconnector folder, "npm install --production", "npm start", and go to "http://localhost:8888/Simulator/index.html") or got directly into Tableau to use the connector
